# RPShell

RPShell is a personnal project that aims to propose a simple but enjoyable shell-based RPG. It is written in Python but I do not exclude the idea of using other languages if I need to.The idea is to offer a simple experience where the player can interact with an environment only using command line.

The <code>main.py</code> file contains all the code related to Python's command line library <code>cmd</code>. It is basically the first brick of the code and allows to call every other needed function.
